       "\"## Where we are Headed\\nAt GitLab, we encourage everyone to work [handbook first](/handbook/about/handbook-usage/#why-handbook-first) in order to promote asynchronous collaboration and documentation. Working this way has its challenges, not the least of which is the time and effort involved in making a change. While this extra investment can encourage contributors to be more considered and deliberate with their changes, at a certain point it discourages meaningful collaboration and works against our goals.\\n\\nOur hope is that the GitLab Handbook is something that others want to emulate. To facilitate that, we want to ensure that any user can easily use and update the handbook. Ideally, the handbook has:\\n\\n- Organized, and up-to-date content\\n- Fast, predictable deployments\\n- A clean, scalable information architecture and modern codebase\\n### What's Next & Why\\nWe are focused on maintaining the handbook's fast (pipeline under 10 minutes) and stable (minimal pipeline failures) state.\""

      "At GitLab, we encourage everyone to work [handbook first](/handbook/about/handbook-usage/#why-handbook-first) in order to promote asynchronous collaboration and documentation. Working this way has its challenges, not the least of which is the time and effort involved in making a change. While this extra investment can encourage contributors to be more considered and deliberate with their changes, at a certain point it discourages meaningful collaboration and works against our goals.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our hope is that the GitLab Handbook is something that others want to emulate. To facilitate that, we want to ensure that any user can easily use and update the handbook. Ideally, the handbook has:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Organized, and up-to-date content\n",
      "- Fast, predictable deployments\n",
      "- A clean, scalable information architecture and modern codebase\n",

      "## Introduction\n",
      "The Handbook is a critical part of empowering team members to do their jobs effectively. As such, we have a group of team members who assist in resolving issues affecting all team members.\n",
      "## Reporting an issue\n",
      "If you're looking for general help, please see the [editing handbook page](editing-handbook/_index.md#need-help).\n",

      "Any work stopping issues should be reported in the [#handbook-escalation](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/CVDP3HG5V) channel in Slack.\n",

      "### When to escalate an issue\n",
      "Issues should only be escalated if it relates to:\",\"### Expectations for the group\n",
      "1. Make sure you are in and do not mute the [#handbook-escalation](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/CVDP3HG5V) channel.\n",
      "1. When an issue is reported:\n",
      "   1. Acknowledge the team member and let them know you are looking into it.\n",
      "   1. You can check on `#production`, `#incident-management`, and `#is-this-known` to see if it's a known issue with infrastructure or other problems.\n",
      "   1. Provide an update as soon as you are able to confirm their problem.\n",
      "   1. You can also post updates in `#mr-buddies` and/or `#handbook` as appropriate.\n",
      "   1. Offer to have a Zoom call to help replicate or resolve the issue if it is not straight forward.\n",
      "   1. Resolve the problem, or provide feedback to the team member on how they can resolve it.\n",
      "   1. If you do not believe you can resolve it and need further assistance, consider any or all of the following:\n",
      "      1. Ping another member of the [Keep main green group](#keep-main-green-group).\",\"> The biggest problem is GitLab not working handbook first. We have an amazing handbook that allows us to collaborate, onboard new people, and think collectively.\n",

      "> However, it is counterintuitive to communicate changes to the handbook. The default of people, when they wish to communicate a change, is to send a Slack message, send an email, give a presentation, or tell people in a meeting — *anything* but make a change in the handbook.\n",
      ">\n",
      "> It's slower for them. It's quicker to use any other form. If they make a change in the handbook, they first have to find the relevant part of the handbook, they sometimes have to adjust the handbook to make sure their change will fit in, they have to go through a technical process and a review or two, and they have to wait a bit before it's deployed.\n",
