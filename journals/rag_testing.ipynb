You\\'re about to become a GitLab developer!\\nMake sure you\\'ve checked out our [handbook](/handbook/) beforehand, so you get a feeling\\nof how we work at GitLab. Below you\\'ll find everything you need to start developing.\\nIf something is missing, add it (as goes with everything at GitLab)!\\n\\n\\nWe have multiple [GitLab environments](/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/environments/).\\n\\nOn those instances, please enable the\\n[performance bar](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/monitoring/performance/performance_bar.html)\\nby pressing <kbd>p</kbd> then <kbd>b</kbd> (even on production.)\\n\\nThen, read how to use and enable the\\n[production Canary](/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/environments/canary-stage/)\\non GitLab.com.\\nTo start development, follow the instructions for the\\n[GitLab Development Kit](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-development-kit).\\nGitLab consists of many subprojects. A curated list of GitLab Repositories\\ncan be found at the [GitLab Engineering Projects](/handbook/engineering/projects/) page.\\n\\nAlmost all repositories are available on both GitLab.com and dev.gitlab.org. We\\nalso mirror to dev.gitlab.org for availability reasons and [GitHub](https://github.com/gitlabhq)\\nfor historical reasons.\\n\\nAll issues should be filed on GitLab.com.\\nFor everything related to infrastructure, check out the\\n[Infrastructure handbook](/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/).\\nIn particular [production architecture](/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/production/architecture/) might be useful for onboarding.\\n\\nIf you need a VPS for any reason, it\\'s probably easiest to set one up at DigitalOcean. Ask another developer for access.\\n\\nPlease see the [engineering workflow document](/handbook/engineering/workflow/) in the handbook and read\\nthe [developer documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/).\\nRead the [developer security documentation](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/release/docs/blob/master/general/security/engineer.md) prior to working on a security issue.\\nOne of GitLab\\'s strengths is its high quality of software. To achieve this we\\'ve\\nintroduced some requirements to all source code that is contributed. All\\nrequirements are mentioned in [the Contribution guide](https://about.gitlab.com/community/contribute/).\\nMake sure you read and follow it.\\nGitLab can be installed through an Omnibus package or from source on different\\nLinux distributions and macOS. In order to maintain portability, we need to\\navoid adding extra dependencies and use of exotic database extensions. Every\\ntime you choose between changes in the application code or adding new\\ndependencies, you should give priority to the first because this is easier to\\nmaintain and set up. If you still need to bring new dependencies to GitLab, ask\\nanother developer or the CTO for advice.', 'score': 0.03131881575727918, 'type': 'hybrid'}, {'id': 11679, 'chunk': '#### Fellow Technical Onboarding\\n#### Tutorials/Videos\\n#### Documentation\\n \\n Slippers is the open-source GitLab Marketing Web Design System.

Inside of it you should have a working `gitlab` folder that contains all the files of the GitLab project.

In the latter case, applying a backport may be impractical as compared to upgrading to the latest version of the software.\\n\\nAt GitLab, we backport security fixes and bug fixes according to the [Maintenance Policy](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/policy/maintenance.html).\\nNo it's not. Backporting is a catch-all term for any activity that applies updates or patches from a newer version of software to an older version. At GitLab we have a specific [Patch Release process](/handbook/engineering/releases/#patch-releases-overview) that is applied according to the [Maintenance Policy](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/policy/maintenance.html). This is one of the release methods we use to ship self-managed, along with the security release and regular monthly release. There is a separate [exception process](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/policy/maintenance.html#backporting-to-older-releases) for backports that are outside the scope of our maintenance policy and these are delivered on a best effort basis and not guaranteed.\\nIf your backport is a bug fix and covered by the maintenance policy, please follow the [Patch Release Process](/handbook/engineering/releases/#patch-release-process).\\n\\nIf your backport is a security fix and covered by the maintenance policy, please follow the [Security Release Process](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/policy/maintenance.html#security-releases).\\n\\nFor anything outside of the maintenance policy, please follow [the exception process](/handbook/engineering/releases/backports/#what-if-my-backport-is-not-covered-by-the-maintenance-policy)\\nBackports require multiple engineers to apply a fix through multiple versions and are time intensive. When reviewing a backport requrest, product managers should consult our [backport policy](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/policy/maintenance.html#backporting-to-older-releases) to ensure that the backport proposal meets the criteria. Product managers should ensure that the severity, priority, customer impact and the potential risks associated with not backporting are properly documented before approval.\\n\\nBackports can be intensive and require many interactions between different groups to get right an deliver successfully. It is likely that a significant amount of time must be set aside to complete this process.\\nBackports can be an effective way to address security flaws and vulnerabilities in older versions of software. However, each backport introduces a fair amount of complexity within the system architecture and can be costly to maintain.\\n\\nFor example, Python 2.7.18 was the final official release of Python 2. In order to remain current with security patches and continue enjoying all of the new developments Python has to offer, organizations needed to upgrade to Python 3 or start freezing requirements and commit to legacy long-term support.\\nEach backport can create many unwanted side effects within the application environment. Just as an upstream software application affects all downstream applications, so too does a backport applied to the core software.\\nBackporting is a common technique to address a known bug within the IT environment. At the same time, relying on a legacy codebase introduces other potentially significant security implications for organizations. Relying on old or legacy code could result in introducing weaknesses or vulnerabilities in your environment. These issues affect not only the main application but also all dependent libraries and forked applications to public repositories. It is important to consider how each backport fits within the organization's overall security strategy, as well as the IT architecture.\", 'score': 0.015384615384615385, 'type': 'hybrid'}, {'id': 19473, 'chunk': \"## Selecting the Right Testing Environment \\n Support Engineers need testing environments to learn how to support GitLab and also to replicate customer issues.\\n\\nThis page explains the main choices available to you. Some guidelines:\\n\\n1. You should choose a way to spin up a specific version of GitLab quickly so that you can replicate customer issues. The current recommended way to do this is to use [GitLab Sandbox Cloud](/handbook/company/infrastructure-standards/realms/sandbox/#how-to-get-started). Each specific module that you'll be using has its own `README.md` in the deployment projects, so make sure to give that a read as well.\\n1. Testing locally is also recommended - configuring Docker Engine / VM based system (details below) to your taste will let you quickly spin up a specific GitLab version.\\n1. You will need licenses for all self-managed tiers so you can match the features available with your customer's features - see the next section.\\n1.

      "|Volledig thuiswerken Aangezien dit project volledig remote is bestaat er een risico dat het benodigde werk om het project succesvol afgerond wordt niet gedaan wordt. Er is niemand om te controleren wat er de hele dag gedaan wordt en het vereist discipline om jezelf aan het werk te houden.|Hoog|Elke werkdag begint met een stand-up waarin er verteld wordt wat er de vorige dag is gedaan en wat er deze dag gedaan moet worden. Dit is een goede stok achter de deur en maakt het snel duidelijk als er geen voortgang wordt gemaakt. Ook worden er wekelijks een meeting gehouden over de voortgang van het project. Om afleiding te minimaliseren heb ik een aparte werkplek geregeld thuis wat helpt een duidelijk balans tussen werk en prive tijd te creeren.|\n",
      "|Communicatie​ Alhoewel het makkelijk is om online te communiceren is het toch niet altijd zo efficient als fysiek op kantoor naar iemand toe te stappen en fysieke meetings te houden.|Laag|Er wordt gecommuniceerd via Slack. Iedereen is meestal goed bereikbaar en als er in de stand-up blijkt dat er een probleem is, kan er vaak direct een moment gevonden worden om het te bespreken.|\n",
      "|Ervaring in nieuwe techieken Ik heb weinig ervaring met Python en het werken met LLMs/AI. Verder is het al een tijd geleden dat ik geprogrammeer heb. Aangezien het project redelijk complex kan worden is het belangrijk dat deze kennis snel wordt verkregen zodat het project goed van start komt|Gemiddeld|Om de ontbrekende kennis te compenseren heb ik de eerste maand onderzoek gedaan en kleine projecten gemaakt in Python om ervaring hierin op te doen. Python is geen erg ingewikkelde taal dus het is goed op te pakken. ​ Verder zijn er verschillende collega’s aanwezig die erg veel ervaring in deze takken hebben en kunnen helpen.|\n",
