They believe that being all-remote allows them to hire the best talent globally, work asynchronously, and document everything. GitLab has been all-remote since inception and is considered one of the world's largest all-remote companies.",
        "generated_answer": "GitLab embraces a fully remote work culture as a core hiring condition. This means that the company operates without any physical premises, and all team members perform 100% of their work remotely. This setup is an essential component of the employment contract, and changes to this arrangement require mutual agreement from both parties in the employment contract [@4].\n\nRemote work at GitLab is flexible, allowing team members to organize their working time, provided they adhere to agreed-upon work hours and minimum rest periods. These include an effective daily working limit and availability during periods communicated with their manager. The work must fit within the standard hours between 9 am and 8 pm, respecting minimum rest periods of 11 consecutive hours between working days and 35 consecutive hours per week [@2].\n\nGitLab provides necessary equipment for remote work, such as laptops and software, and reimburses for any professional expenses related to remote work, including utilities like Wi-Fi and electricity, up to a specified amount. They also ensure that the remote work environment complies with health, safety, and working condition standards [@5].\n\nFurthermore, GitLab's Remote Work Report 2021 highlights their commitment to a remote-first environment and showcases the benefits and challenges of distributed work. Key takeaways emphasize the importance of flexibility, transparency, and the mainstream acceptance of remote work as a long-term trend [@3].\n\nOverall, GitLab's policies are designed to support remote work with flexible arrangements, provision of necessary resources, and adherence to compliance and safety standards.",

        "question": "What is GitLab's approach to feature flags?",
        "golden_answer": "GitLab uses feature flags to separately deploy code and enable features. This allows them to test features in production with selected users before rolling them out to everyone. They have a dedicated GitLab Feature Flag service that developers use to implement feature flags. GitLab recommends cleaning up feature flags once they are no longer needed for their intended purpose.",
        "generated_answer": "GitLab uses feature flags as a crucial part of both development and operations to ensure a stable, agile, and efficient deployment process. Feature flags allow developers to ship changes early, manage their rollout, and ensure the application's continued stability and performance. The use of feature flags helps control which features are active, thus enabling controlled experimentation and feature testing without immediately affecting the entire user base [@2].\n\nGitLab incorporates feature flags in the lifecycle of product development, where they serve several purposes. They are necessary for deploying any changes that could impact existing functionalities, such as new features in high-traffic areas, complex security updates, and invasive UI changes [@3]. Feature flags de-risk changes by allowing engineers to monitor and adjust the impact of their modifications. This supports good DevOps practices by enabling gradual rollouts and Continuous Delivery without needing immediate full-scale deployment [@3].\n\nThe benefits of feature flags include not slowing down the development process, reducing Mean-Time-To-Recovery, and providing engineers psychological safety since they can quickly disable a feature if problems arise. Furthermore, optimizing for worst-case scenarios by using feature flags saves costs compared to undoing problematic deployments [@5].\n\nThe lifecycle of a feature flag involves planning, development, and rollout stages. During planning, it's important to decide on the necessity and implementation specifics of the feature flag. Development includes incorporating the flag and adjusting both backend and frontend code. Rollout involves executing a planned incremental introduction of the feature, monitoring, and possibly removing the flag for complete activation if successful [@3].\n\nIn summary, GitLab's approach to feature flags focuses on flexibility, control, and reducing risk in development, allowing teams to deliver new features efficiently and safely.",

        "question": "How does GitLab handle database changes and migrations?",
        "golden_answer": "GitLab uses migrations to handle database changes. They differentiate between regular and post-deployment migrations. Regular migrations run before the new code is deployed, while post-deployment migrations run after the new code is deployed. This approach allows GitLab to make database changes without downtime. All migrations should be reversible to enable rollbacks if needed.",
        "generated_answer": "GitLab handles database changes and migrations through a structured process that emphasizes consistency across different editions (such as between GitLab CE/EE and JiHu). Here are the key aspects of this process:\n\n1. **Routes for Database Migrations**: GitLab defines two main routes for handling database migrations:\n   - **Upstream fully**: Contributing the database migrations along with the corresponding code changes to GitLab.\n   - **Upstream migrations only**: Contributing only the database migrations without the associated code changes, typically used for proprietary features like those in JiHu. \n\n2. **Schema Changes**: All database migrations are sent to the upstream project to maintain a consistent database schema across different GitLab versions, ensuring that the schema remains the same for both GitLab and JiHu editions. Specific JiHu database objects are annotated with PostgreSQL comments to clarify their relevance in regular GitLab environments [@2].\n\n3. **Data Migrations**: Data migrations that involve mutating existing data are merged into the upstream project. However, efforts are made to avoid executing JiHu-specific data migrations in regular GitLab environments, such as on GitLab.com [@3].\n\n4. **Review Process**: The database review process is thorough, with related code changes expected to be ready and reviewed before the database migrations are reviewed. This ensures that reviewers have the necessary context to provide meaningful feedback [@2].\n\n5. **Migration File Cleanup**: An initiative was taken to improve GitLab CI jobs' performance and reduce maintenance costs by cleaning up old migration files. Migration files before version 14 have been squashed into a single `init_schema` file to streamline the initialization of new GitLab instances [@4].\n\n6. **Handling of JiHu Specific Migrations**: There are specific guidelines for handling JiHu proprietary features that require database changes, ensuring compatibility and seamless migration paths between JiHu and GitLab editions [@3].\n\nThese processes ensure that database migrations are handled in a manner that maintains compatibility across different editions and reduces the operational overhead while also enhancing the performance of GitLab services.\n\n**Follow-up Questions:**\n1. What are the specific roles and responsibilities in the GitLab database review process?\n2. How are migration conflicts resolved between GitLab CE/EE and JiHu versions?\n3.

        "golden_answer": "GitLab's Merge Request (MR) workflow involves creating a branch, making changes, submitting a Merge Request, reviewing the changes, and merging once approved. MRs should be kept small and focused, have a clear description of the changes, and include any necessary context. The submitter is responsible for assigning reviewers and addressing their feedback. MRs should also include automated tests and documentation updates if applicable.",
        "generated_answer": "GitLab's Merge Request (MR) workflow includes several best practices that ensure efficient and systematic code integration and deployment. Here is an outline of these practices based on the GitLab Handbook:\n\n1. **Use Feature Branches**: Instead of directly committing to the main branch, developers should use feature branches to keep the source code clean and facilitate easier code review processes [@1].\n\n2. **Testing**: It is advised to run tests on all commits, not just those on the main branch. This includes running Application Security scans on feature branches for every commit [@1].\n\n3. **Code Review Workflow**:\n   - Push your changes to GitLab and open a merge request (MR).\n   - Request reviewers to approve your MR.\n   - If CI/CD automation is set up, wait for successful test results before merging.\n   - Reviewers approve the MR or request changes. The author must address these changes.\n   - Once all required reviewers have approved and there are no conflicts, the MR can be safely merged [@1].\n\n4. **Code Review Best Practices**:\n   - It\u2019s important to have the MR reviewed by experts from each relevant domain (backend, frontend, database, etc.).\n   - Include application security-related checks if necessary.\n   - Thorough descriptions and understanding of the code changes should be maintained to facilitate effective reviews [@1].\n\n5. **Merging the Merge Request**:\n   - Ensure the MR has the correct type labels applied and consider any warnings or errors that might have been flagged.\n   - If any quality-related changes are present, they should be approved by a Software Engineer in Test.\n   - At least one maintainer must approve an MR before it can be merged.\n   - The merge should generally be performed by the final approver, unless certain exceptional scenarios occur [@4].\n\n6. **Deployment and Tags**:\n   - Deployments can happen automatically based on branches or tags.\n   - Tags are set manually by users to trigger specific CI/CD actions.\n   - Release processes are managed based on tags to ensure an organized development environment [@4].\n\nThese steps form a comprehensive workflow that helps maintain the quality and efficiency of code development and integration at GitLab [@1][@4].\n\n**Follow-up Questions:**\n1.

After the cliff, options vest monthly. RSUs also vest over 4 years but on a quarterly schedule. The equity package is calculated based on the role's target equity percentage and the team member's location factor.",
        "generated_answer": "GitLab's stock option program offers employees the possibility to receive Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) and stock options, which are reviewed for approval on a quarterly basis. New hires typically see 12.5% of their RSUs vest after approximately six months, with the remaining amount vesting quarterly over the next 3.5 years, making it a total of four years for complete vesting. There are no cliffs for promotion and refresh grants, so they vest quarterly over four years as well [@1].\n\nWhen it comes to exercising stock options, an individual buys the stock per the terms of their option agreement, paying the exercise price set when the options were first granted. GitLab allows its stock options to be immediately exercisable, providing opportunities to benefit from any existing tax incentives. However, this comes with a company's right to repurchase unvested shares if the employment ends. It's advisable to consult a tax advisor before proceeding with an early exercise due to potential tax implications [@1].\n\nGitLab's stock option administration is conducted via the E*TRADE platform, with equity grants approved by the Board of Directors at quarterly meetings. If employment ends, employees typically have a three-month window to exercise any vested options, after which they expire [@1].\n\nFor tax purposes, there are complexities particularly for U.S. employees with Incentive Stock Options (ISOs), where timing and type of sale determine the tax implications. Non-US service providers and employees in the Netherlands, Germany, Australia, and the UK have slightly different tax treatments. In the U.S., GitLab's stock is considered a Qualified Small Business Stock (QSBS) which offers tax advantages for shares exercised before August 2018 [@1].\n\nMoreover, GitLab has implemented a dual-class stock structure providing different voting rights, where Class A common stock and Class B stock have different governance implications [@1].\n\nOverall, the program is designed to offer long-term benefits to employees, but it is complex and comes with various considerations, particularly regarding taxation.

Here's a detailed overview based on the information from the GitLab Handbook:\n\n1. **Collaboration with UX and Engineering**:\n   - Engineering, product management, and product design collaborate closely throughout the product development process to ensure the creation of high-quality and functional products. Using `workflow::design`, these teams discuss complexities and uncover blockers in the proposed solutions. Product Designers work with Engineering and Product Managers to design user experiences for features, which are then implemented by Engineering during specific milestones [@1].\n\n2. **Breaking Down Issues for Iteration**:\n   - GitLab emphasizes breaking large solutions into smaller, actionable issues for efficiency and effectiveness. This involves multiple roles including PM, Engineers, Product Designer, QA, and Technical Writer, who work together to deliver valuable features to early customers. The process relies on continuous feedback and the adoption of Minimal Viable Changes (MVC) to satisfy initial customer needs [@1].\n\n3. **Inclusive Development**:\n   - The development process is designed to be inclusive, with over-communication as a key principle. Engaging all stakeholders from the outset ensures transparency and maximizes contributions from different perspectives. Frequent communication ensures all relevant parties are updated about the progress and involvement of various teams [@1].\n\n4. **Use of Feature Flags**:\n   - GitLab employs feature flags during development to manage the release of new features and minimize customer disruption. This also involves notifying customer support and success teams about new feature rollouts, enhancing internal collaboration [@1].\n\n5. **Spikes for Investigation**:\n   - Spikes are used as time-boxed investigations when there's uncertainty regarding the development of a feature. These are collaborative efforts among multiple team members, ensuring diverse viewpoints and focused research. Spikes are limited in number and duration to maintain efficiency [@1].\n\nOverall, GitLab's product development approach is characterized by clear communication, iterative development, efficient issue resolution, and active stakeholder engagement to create valuable and user-focused products.\n\n### Follow-up Questions:\n- How does GitLab track inactive issues during product development?\n- What is the role of product designers in GitLab's development process?\n- Can you explain more about the use and management of feature flags in GitLab?",

        "question": "I need to take a few days off next month. What's the exact procedure for requesting Paid Time Off (PTO), and do I need to specify a reason?",
        "golden_answer": "To request PTO at GitLab: 1) Enter your time off in the PTO by Deel system, 2) Add it to your calendar with the \"[Out of Office]\" prefix in the title, 3) Update your GitLab Status Page with the dates you'll be away, 4) Set an email auto-responder if needed, and 5) Notify your manager and team members. You don't need to specify a reason for taking PTO - GitLab has an unlimited time off policy that's based on trust and results rather than tracking hours. The only requirement is to communicate your absence properly so others can plan accordingly.",
        "generated_answer": "To request Paid Time Off (PTO) at GitLab, you should follow these steps:\n\n1. **Coordination with Manager**: You need to coordinate with your manager about your planned time off. The company expects you to inform your manager at least twice as many days in advance as the number of days you plan to take off. For example, if you plan to take 3 days off, inform your manager at least 6 business days in advance.\n\n2. **Team Coordination**: After discussing with your manager, coordinate with your team, especially if your time off coincides with popular holidays or critical periods for your department.\n\n3. **Entry in Workday**: All time off, including PTO, public holidays, and other types of leave, must be entered into Workday, which serves as the single source of truth for logging time off. This entry will create an event that captures your out-of-office dates and notifies your manager.\n\n4. **Limitations**: If your planned leave exceeds 25 calendar days (including weekends and holidays), contact your Manager, relevant People Business Partner, and the Absence Management Team for a special request.\n\n5. **No Specific Reason Required**: While you should coordinate the time off with your manager and team, there is no requirement to specify a reason for taking PTO. However, there's an option to provide additional details, such as selecting \"Vacation\" from a dropdown menu in Workday, if desired [@2].\n\nAdditionally, it's encouraged that team members take time off for mental health reasons, holidays specific to their country, and other personal needs. Not taking regular time off is seen negatively and considered bad for your and the company's health and productivity [@3].\n\n**Follow-up Questions:**\n1. What if my manager is not available for coordination close to my requested days off?\n2. How do I log unexpected sick days in Workday compared to planned PTO?\n3. Are there any guidelines on how to handle work duties before going on PTO?",

        "question": "How does GitLab actively promote Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging (DIB) within the company, beyond just stating it as a value?",
        "golden_answer": "GitLab actively promotes DIB through multiple initiatives: 1) Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) that provide support and community for team members with shared identities or experiences, 2) Inclusion training for all team members, 3) A dedicated DIB team that creates programs and policies, 4) Regular company-wide DIB surveys to measure progress, 5) Inclusive hiring practices including diverse interview panels and removing bias from job descriptions, 6) Inclusive language guidelines in their communication, 7) Regular DIB events and discussions, and 8) Transparency in reporting DIB metrics and progress.",
        "generated_answer": "GitLab actively promotes Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging (DIB) by embedding these principles deeply into its culture and operational strategies. Here are some key initiatives and practices GitLab employs to advance DIB:\n\n1. **A.D.A.P.T. Framework**: GitLab's DIB Team has developed the A.D.A.P.T. framework, which stands for Action, Doing Good, Accountability, Policies, and Transparency. This framework guides the company in implementing strategies to attract, progress, and retain diverse team members and engage with open-source communities. Each component focuses on essential aspects such as intentional action, contributing to communities, maintaining accountability, creating equitable policies, and ensuring transparency [@1].\n\n2. **Fully Distributed Workforce**: By embracing an all-remote model, GitLab opens its doors to a global talent pool, eliminating geographical barriers that might limit diversity. This approach supports inclusivity by allowing team members to work from where they are most comfortable, including those with physical disabilities or those who are caregivers [@5].\n\n3. **Talent Acquisition and Retention**: GitLab integrates inclusive hiring practices by ensuring interviewers are trained in diversity and cultural competence. They use platforms like Greenhouse Inclusion to maintain inclusive recruitment processes and offer candidates the opportunity to meet with Team Member Resource Groups (TMRGs) during hiring [@4].\n\n4. **Workshops and Training**: GitLab conducts workshops such as the #IamRemarkable initiative, encouraging self-promotion among team members. Workshops are designed to increase psychological safety and personal development [@1].\n\n5. **Inclusive Language and Policies**: The company uses inclusive language in its communications and policies, ensuring all team members feel recognized and valued. They publish information about inclusive benefits publicly to remove barriers during interviews [@1].\n\n6. **Team Member Resource Groups (TMRGs)**: GitLab fosters community and support networks within the company by establishing TMRGs. These groups provide a platform for team members to connect, share experiences, and advocate for diversity-related initiatives [@5].\n\n7. **Diversity in Leadership**: GitLab emphasizes the importance of having diverse leadership, as it contributes to better decision-making and innovation. They actively monitor and support the representation of underrepresented groups in senior roles [@1].\n\nOverall, GitLab's approach to DIB is comprehensive and iteratively developed to ensure all team members can contribute and thrive in an inclusive environment. They continuously seek to enhance these strategies by addressing regional needs and pursuing additional underrepresented groups [@1].",

        "golden_answer": "GitLab conducts formal performance reviews twice a year (mid-year and end-of-year). The \"Performance/Growth Factor\" is a numerical rating (0.0 to 2.0) given to team members during these reviews that reflects their performance relative to expectations for their role and level. A factor of 1.0 means meeting expectations, below 1.0 indicates underperformance, and above 1.0 indicates exceeding expectations. This factor is used in compensation calculations and influences promotion decisions.",
        "generated_answer": "GitLab conducts formal talent assessments at least once a year, specifically in the fourth quarter (Q4), and recommends an informal mid-year check-in for employees. The formal assessment takes place prior to the annual compensation review to ensure that it is part of the overall performance and compensation cycle [@1].\n\nThe \"Performance/Growth Potential\" factor is assessed through a matrix used to evaluate team members' performance and growth potential. This matrix is completed multiple times a year by executive groups for their direct reports. It involves several steps, including self-evaluations, manager evaluations, calibration sessions, and executive reviews. The performance and growth potential factors derived from this process help in determining the annual compensation reviews, among other developmental actions [@1][@2]. \n\nThe Growth Potential is assessed based on four key pillars and can result in team members being categorized as \"Exceeding,\" \"Growing,\" \"Developing,\" or \"Too New to Rate,\" reflecting their readiness to take on more responsibilities or their need for further development [@1][@2].\n\n### Follow-up Questions:\n1. Can you provide more details about the specific criteria used in the performance and growth evaluations?\n2. How do self-evaluations and manager evaluations differ in this process?\n3. What kind of feedback or development actions are taken following the performance/growth assessments?",

        "question": "My CI/CD pipeline failed with a 'script timeout' error while running tests. Where in the handbook can I find common causes and troubleshooting steps for pipeline timeouts?",
        "golden_answer": "Pipeline timeouts can be caused by: 1) Tests that take too long to run, 2) Inefficient test configurations, 3) Resource constraints on the GitLab Runner, 4) Large dependency downloads, or 5) Network issues. Troubleshooting steps include: 1) Check the timeout settings in your .gitlab-ci.yml file and adjust as needed, 2) Review the job logs to identify which specific tests are taking the most time, 3) Consider parallelizing your tests, 4) Use caching for dependencies, 5) Make sure your tests are properly optimized, and 6) Consider using higher-resourced runners if available.",
        "generated_answer": "To troubleshoot script timeout errors in your GitLab CI/CD pipeline, you can refer to several common root causes and steps to address them, as outlined in the GitLab Handbook:\n\n1. **Code changes**: It's essential to check if any new code was deployed that might affect the tests. You can find the difference between the current and previous GitLab versions using a URL like `https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security/gitlab/-/compare/start_commit_sha...end_commit_sha` to identify changes that could have impacted your pipeline.\n\n2. **Feature Flag**: Analyze if a new feature flag is enabled. Feature flag changes are reported to specific QA pipeline Slack channels, which may also trigger a full QA job. Checking historic changes via the [feature-flag-log](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/feature-flag-log) project can also help.\n\n3. **Environment / Infrastructure**: If no code or feature flag changes occurred and you face flaky errors in the environment, start by analyzing Sentry errors and Kibana logs. Check the `#incident-management` channel for ongoing incidents and whether they might contribute to failures. Also, ensure canary is not disabled if applicable by using canary chatops commands.\n\n4. **Test Data**: Assure that your test data is valid, as environments like Staging and Production rely on pre-existing data.\n\n5. **New GitLab QA version**: Check if a new [GitLab QA version](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-qa/-/tags?sort=updated_desc) has been released [@1].\n\nThis page also provides further insights into classifying and triaging test failures, along with specific labels and guidelines for bugs, flaky tests, and external dependencies. For example, flaky tests can be caused by issues like not waiting for pages to load fully or animations preventing element interactions. For comprehensive guidance, please refer to the [GitLab handbook on pipeline triage and troubleshooting](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/content-sites/handbook/-/tree/main/content/handbook/engineering/infrastructure-platforms/developer-experience/pipeline-triage.md) [@1].\n\n### Follow-up Questions:\n1. What specific code changes could potentially impact my tests?\n2. How can I track feature flag changes more effectively?\n3. What are the best practices for managing test data in staging environments?\n4. How do I communicate pipeline issues quickly within GitLab's incident management channels?",

        "golden_answer": "For team members in the Netherlands, GitLab provides parental leave that complies with local regulations while maintaining their global standard of 16 weeks fully paid leave. Specifically: 1) Birth parents receive 16 weeks of fully paid leave (which includes the mandatory leave required by Dutch law), 2) Non-birth parents receive 16 weeks of fully paid leave, 3) Team members must be employed for at least 3 months to be eligible, 4) The leave can be taken continuously or split into two periods, and 5) The leave must be taken within the first year after the child's birth or placement. For country-specific details including how GitLab's policy integrates with the Dutch government benefits, employees should consult the Country-Specific Policies section of the Parental Leave page.",
        "generated_answer": "The GitLab Handbook provides specific information regarding parental leave policies for employees based in the Netherlands. As of the latest updates from the Netherlands GitLab Handbook:\n\n1. **Parental Leave**: Team members with children aged 8 or younger are entitled to take unpaid parental leave. The leave can amount to 26 times the number of weekly work hours. Employees who are eligible for parental leave can also receive up to 9 weeks of partial pay through the Dutch government agency UWV during the child's first year after birth. The UWV will cover 70% of the daily wage, up to 70% of the maximum daily wage, and GitLab will help apply for this benefit [@1].\n\n2. **Maternity Leave**: GitLab employees in the Netherlands follow the statutory maternity leave policy. Typically, this involves paid leave as regulated by Dutch law. You should consult the specific GitLab policy for details regarding the management of this leave [@4].\n\n3. **Paternity/Partner Leave**: There is statutory paternity or partner leave policy, but specific terms and conditions may apply. Like other benefits, these are likely aligned with the Dutch statutory requirements, which should ensure some paid leave period following the birth of a child [@3].\n\nFor the most detailed and specific information, especially for procedural queries or updates to existing policies, employees should reach out to GitLab\u2019s Absence Management team or check the People Operations page for assistance [@2].",
